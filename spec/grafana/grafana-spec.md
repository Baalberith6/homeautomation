## Dashboard Architecture

### Overview

Home automation dashboard built with Grafana + InfluxDB (Flux queries) + Business Text plugin (`marcusolsson-dynamictext-panel`). All custom panels use Handlebars templates with inline CSS. Canvas-based panels (70, 68) use `afterRender` JavaScript for animated visualizations.

Grafana config requires `disable_sanitize_html = true` in grafana.ini under `[panels]`.

### Grid Layout (v5)

Two-column layout: column 1 = 15 units (62.5%), column 2 = 9 units (37.5%).

```
Row  0-11:  [70 Outdoor (0,0,15,12)]           [67 Indoor (15,0,9,12)]
Row 12-18:  [80 Energy Topology (0,12,15,7)]    [83 Heat Tiles (15,12,9,5)]
Row 17-21:  ┃                                   [84 TC Chart (15,17,9,5)]
Row 19-31:  [81 Energy Chart (0,19,15,13)]      [85 Heat Stats (15,22,9,5)]
Row 27-36:  ┃                                   [86 Vehicles (15,27,9,10)]
Row 32-36:  [82 Energy Stats (0,32,15,5)]
```

## Redesign v5 — Consolidated Color Decisions

This section locks the canonical color mapping for the v5 dashboard redesign (`redesign-v5.html`). It supersedes any ad-hoc color choices in the redesign HTML and resolves conflicts across the original panels. Decisions approved by @matej.pristak on 2026-04-19.

### Semantic tokens

| Token | Hex | Canonical role |
|---|---|---|
| `--red` | `#f2495c` | Error / over-threshold / discharge-alarm |
| `--orange` | `#FF9830` | Warning / bojlery (hot water) / return temp / wallbox active |
| `--orange-red` | `#FF6B3D` | Battery/Car SoC 10–20% tier |
| `--yellow` | `#FADE2A` | Battery kW (charge/discharge) / inverter-temp 40–50 °C |
| `--green` | `#73bf69` | House consumption / SoC green tier (30–90) / OK / OTE cheap |
| `--green-dark` | `#37872D` | Heat-pump flow / target temp |
| `--green-deep` | `#4a9e3f` | Solar production tier 2–4 kW |
| `--green-light` | `#a6e09e` | Solar production tier 0–2 kW |
| `--blue` | `#5794F2` | Solar identity / humidity / SoC top tier (>90) / forecast low |
| `--blue-light` | `#73C0F5` | Solar production tier 4–6 kW / grid export mild |
| `--blue-dark` | `#3d6fd4` | Solar production tier >8 kW |
| `--purple` | `#B877D9` | Rain (only — not reused) |
| `--dim` | `#8e8e8e` | Dim labels / idle values |
| `--muted` | `#555` | Zero-line / heavily muted decoration |
| `--text` | `#d8d9da` | Primary text |
| `--bg` | `#181b1f` | Panel background |
| `--card` / `--card-2` / `--card-3` | `#1e2228` / `#1a1d22` / `#15181c` | Card fills |

### Solar / PV production — 6-tier ladder (C1)

**Visualization:** 20-bar ladder at the card background (1 bar = 500 W, max 10 kW). Each bar is colored by its own tier; lit bars (≤ current output) at opacity .32, partial bar at .18, dim at .06.

| kW range | Hex | Tier |
|---|---|---|
| 0–1 kW | `#a6e09e` | Tier 1 — light green |
| 1–2 kW | `#73bf69` | Tier 2 — green |
| 2–4 kW | `#4a9e3f` | Tier 3 — deep green |
| 4–6 kW | `#73C0F5` | Tier 4 — light blue |
| 6–8 kW | `#5794F2` | Tier 5 — blue |
| > 8 kW | `#3d6fd4` | Tier 6 — dark blue |

Solar **identity color** (card stroke, icon, kW value, flow arrow) = `#5794F2`. Only the ladder bars change with intensity.

### Battery flow (kW, signed) (C2)

Canonical yellow for battery-direction visualization: **`#FADE2A`**. Retires panel-2's `#F2CC0C`. Applies to: battery card stroke, battery kW value, flow arrow Inverter→Battery, inverter allocation-bar battery segment.

### Battery SoC ramp (earlier decision, C12)

20-piece strip inside battery card (each piece = 5%). Lit pieces use the current-tier color from the ramp below; dim pieces use the same hue at low opacity.

| SoC | Hex |
|---|---|
| > 90% | `#5794F2` |
| 30–90% | `#73bf69` |
| 20–30% | `#FF9830` |
| 10–20% | `#FF6B3D` |
| < 10% | `#f2495c` |

### Grid state coloring (C3)

| State | Text / value color | When |
|---|---|---|
| Idle / balanced | `#a8a9aa` (neutral) | \|kW\| < 0.1 |
| Import (buying) | `#f2495c` | kW > +0.1 |
| Export (selling) | `#73bf69` | kW < −0.1 |

Card stroke stays neutral `#a8a9aa` at .45 opacity to preserve card identity.

### Grid — 20-bar diverging ladder

10 bars left of a zero-marker (export) + 10 bars right (import). 1 bar = 1 kW, range ±10 kW. Bars color-coded by their own tier regardless of current kW; lit bars (between zero and current draw) at opacity .32, partial bar at .18, rest dim at .06. Zero marker is a 1 px `#d8d9da` line at opacity .35.

**Export half (left, greens, mild → heavy):**

| kW range | Hex |
|---|---|
| 0 – 2 kW | `#a6e09e` light green |
| 2 – 4 kW | `#73bf69` green |
| 4 – 6 kW | `#4a9e3f` deep green |
| > 6 kW | `#37872D` dark green |

**Import half (right, yellow → red, mild → heavy):**

| kW range | Hex |
|---|---|
| 0 – 2 kW | `#FADE2A` yellow |
| 2 – 4 kW | `#FF9830` orange |
| 4 – 6 kW | `#FF6B3D` orange-red |
| > 6 kW | `#f2495c` red |

Approved 2026-04-19 — supersedes the older 3-band "mild/moderate/heavy" spec at lines 148-153.

### Outdoor temperature — 5-tier ladder (C4)

From panel 70, adopted verbatim:

| Range | Hex |
|---|---|
| ≤ −10 °C | `#1565C0` |
| 0 °C | `#4fc3f7` |
| 10 °C | `#f2cc0c` |
| 20 °C | `#FF9830` |
| ≥ 30 °C | `#f2495c` |

Interpolate linearly between anchors.

### Indoor temperature — 10-step ramp (C5)

From panel 67, adopted verbatim (see "Indoor Temperature Color Gradient" table above).

### CO₂ thresholds (C6)

Bug fix: 1025 ppm must render `#f2495c` red (was rendering orange in redesign). Thresholds remain per the UI Colors table above: `<800 #73bf69 · 800–1000 #FF9830 · >1000 #f2495c`.

### Humidity (C7)

Unified to **`#5794F2`** across all panels (indoor + weather). Retires panel-67's `#6e9fff`.

### Solar radiation — 4-tier thresholds (C8)

New tiering:

| W/m² | Hex |
|---|---|
| < 200 | `#73bf69` (green) |
| 200–399 | `#FADE2A` (yellow) |
| 400–599 | `#FF9830` (orange) |
| ≥ 600 | `#f2495c` (red) |

### Heat-pump / TC temperatures (C9, revised for Heating panel)

| Metric | Hex | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Target temp | `#73bf69` (green) | panel 47 | Shown in Heat-Pump tile as "out" value and in the stat-bar below the chart |
| Water temp (bečka) | `#FADE2A` (yellow) | panel 47 | Shown in Heat-Pump tile as "in" value and in the stat-bar; also used for the lower line in the TC chart |

Chart legend above the TC graph has been removed; the stat-bar carries the series identity. Orange was retired here to avoid a three-way collision with wallbox and consumption oranges, and to lock "water temp = yellow" as a panel-wide convention.

### Car / EV SoC — 5-tier ramp + fixed-band bar (C10)

Mirrors the Battery SoC ramp exactly:

| SoC | Hex |
|---|---|
| > 90% | `#5794F2` |
| 30–90% | `#73bf69` |
| 20–30% | `#FF9830` |
| 10–20% | `#FF6B3D` |
| < 10% | `#f2495c` |

Retires panel-61's 3-step ramp. Purple `#B877D9` no longer used for cars — reserved exclusively for rain.

**Bar rendering (panel-61 technique, hard bands):** the SoC bar carries a full-width gradient with **hard stops** at 10 / 20 / 30 / 90 %, so each tier occupies a fixed width of the track regardless of current SoC. An opaque cover (width = 100 − SoC %) is drawn on top of the unfilled right portion. This prevents the earlier behaviour where the whole red-orange-green ramp stretched to fit the fill width; instead, each colour band has a constant on-screen length and the current SoC is communicated by where the cover starts.

CSS stops:
```
linear-gradient(90deg,
  #f2495c 0%,  #f2495c 10%,
  #FF6B3D 10%, #FF6B3D 20%,
  #FF9830 20%, #FF9830 30%,
  #73bf69 30%, #73bf69 90%,
  #5794F2 90%, #5794F2 100%);
```

**Charging pulse:** `@keyframes car-pulse { 0,100% {opacity:1} 50% {opacity:.4} }`, 2 s ease-in-out, ported from `panel-61-cars.jsx`. Applied to the gradient layer only so the target marker and label stay static.

### Hot water (bojlery) (C11)

Reserved color: **`#FF9830`** (same as panel 2). No other metric uses this hue in the boiler context.

### House — 20-bar consumption ladder

1 bar = 500 W, 20 bars = 10 kW max. Same rendering mechanics as Solar (lit .32 / partial .18 / dim .06). Tier colors verbatim from the "House consumption" table above:

| kW range | Bars (0-indexed) | Hex |
|---|---|---|
| 0 – 2 kW | 0 – 3 | `#73bf69` green |
| 2 – 4 kW | 4 – 7 | `#FADE2A` yellow |
| 4 – 6 kW | 8 – 11 | `#FF9830` orange |
| > 6 kW | 12 – 19 | `#f2495c` red |

House identity (card stroke, icon, kW value) stays `#73bf69`.

### Wallbox — 20-bar charging ladder

1 bar = 500 W, 20 bars = 10 kW max (covers 3-phase 16 A ≈ 11 kW). Approved 2026-04-19 — original panels only defined active/inactive, so this is a new decision.

| kW range | Bars (0-indexed) | Hex |
|---|---|---|
| 0 – 4 kW | 0 – 7 | `#FADE2A` yellow |
| 4 – 8 kW | 8 – 15 | `#FF9830` orange |
| > 8 kW | 16 – 19 | `#f2495c` red |

**Disconnected state:** when no car is connected, render all 20 bars at `#4a4a4a` opacity .06 (overrides tier colors entirely). Card stroke `#6a6a6a` at opacity .5 when idle / disconnected; flips to `#FF9830` when charging draw > 0.

### Inverter alerts & temperature (earlier decisions, revised)

**Header** — only the `⚙ INVERTER` caption. The `hybrid 10 kW` capacity sub-label has been removed; alert-state semantics now live entirely in the phase-balance bar (where the offending phase is colour-coded red) and in the diagnostic-message stripe at the bottom of the card.

**Inverter temperature thresholds** — bottom-left of card:
| Range | Hex |
|---|---|
| ≤ 40 °C | `#73bf69` |
| 41–50 °C | `#FADE2A` |
| 51–60 °C | `#FF9830` |
| > 60 °C | `#f2495c` |

**Diagnostic message** — bottom-right of card, adjacent to temperature. Source: **Panel 36 FVE.diag**.
- Normal operation (code < 80): `#73BF69` green, pulsing LED-style status dot, message text e.g. "Normal operation"
- Fault (code ≥ 80): `#f2495c` red, same pulse, diagnostic string from inverter
- Font: 15 px, weight 700
- LED dot: `r=4.5`, 2.4 s opacity pulse animation (1 → 0.4 → 1)

### Inverter — Phase Balance Bar (big bar, 3 segments)

Replaces the earlier BATT/HOUSE allocation bar. Source: **Panel 50 FVE Phases** (L1/L2/L3 live load in kW).

**Layout** — three equal segments inside a `324 × 48` container:

| Seg | x | width | corners |
|---|---|---|---|
| L1 | 0 | 106 | `rx=6` (outer left) |
| L2 | 109 | 106 | no rx (middle) |
| L3 | 218 | 106 | `rx=6` (outer right) |

3-px visual gaps at x=106–109 and x=215–218 create natural "chip" separation at the seams. Each segment is independently color-coded by its own kW load.

**Per-phase tier (each of L1/L2/L3 evaluated independently):**
| kW | Hex |
|---|---|
| ≤ 1 kW | `#73bf69` green |
| 1 – 2 kW | `#FADE2A` yellow |
| 2 – 3 kW | `#FF9830` orange |
| > 3 kW | `#f2495c` red — over-threshold; phase visually flagged in the bar |

**Per-segment text (dark `#0a0c0e` on bright tier fills, centered):**
- Phase label at y=21, font-size 12, letter-spacing 1.4, weight 800 ("L1" / "L2" / "L3")
- kW value at y=40, font-size 17 weight 800, with inline 10-px " kW" tspan

**Rationale:** surfaces which phase is the source of an overcurrent condition at a glance, and preserves the operator's ability to spot heavy-phase asymmetry at a distance on the tablet. Over-threshold colouring lives in the bar itself — there is no separate capacity title string (the v5 header is just `⚙ INVERTER`).

### Heating panel — top-row tiles (revised)

Three tiles, left to right: **Krb · COP · Heat Pump**. Chart legend above the TC graph is removed; identity is carried by the stat-bar below the chart.

**Krb tile** (fireplace):
- Caption: `Krb` (no "Fireplace ·" prefix)
- Status pill top-right — 4-state colour per the **Status pills → Krb (fireplace)** table below (gray/red/green/orange by ON/OFF × body-temp band). The simple 2-colour "green when `krb_w > 20`, red otherwise" rule is retired.
- Current body temp: big green value (e.g. 21.1°)
- Rate of change ("per hour" cool/heat): prominent 28 px blue, right of the temp, arrow glyph (`↓` cooling, `↑` heating) + value + `°/h` unit
- `last fire` timestamp **removed** — not available in current data setup

**COP tile:**
- Caption: `COP · 24h`
- Big value coloured from the continuous Red→Yellow→Green gradient of Panel 49 (`panel-49-cop.jsx`), mapped 0…5. 4.49 → `--green-deep` (#4a9e3f)
- Inline 3-hour delta to the right of the big value: 20 px arrow + value (↑ 0.18) followed by muted `last 3h` caption. Arrow colour tracks direction (↑ green, ↓ red, flat dim)
- Other subtext (target / "excellent") removed

**Heat Pump tile:**
- Caption: `Heat Pump`, Running/Idle pill top-right
- Two paired temps, 32 px each, separated by slash:
  - `out` (heated feed going out to the loop) — always **yellow** `#FADE2A`
  - `in` (cooler water returning from the loop) — always **blue** `#5794F2`
- These colours are **fixed** to the in/out semantic and are deliberately independent of the chart series below (which uses green = target temp, yellow = water temp)
- All other subtext removed

**TC water-temp chart:**
- No legend, no title bar
- Two lines: green `#73bf69` (target temp, upper band) and yellow `#FADE2A` (water temp, lower band)

**Stat-bar below chart:**
| Slot | Label | Color |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `Target temp` | `#73bf69` green |
| 2 | `Water temp` | `#FADE2A` yellow |
| 3 | `Δ` | default text |
| 4 | `Trend 1h` | `#5794F2` blue |

Both trend indicators on this panel — the Krb rate-of-change (`↓ 0.3 °/h`) and the TC water `Trend 1h` — are hourly trends, sourced over the same 1-hour window, so their formatting and cadence stay in sync.

### OTE price tiers (earlier, C-lock)

Discrete 3-tier (retains panel-69 gradient endpoints):
| Kč/kWh | Hex |
|---|---|
| < 0.5 | `#73bf69` (cheap) |
| 0.5–2.0 | `#FF9830` (medium) |
| ≥ 2.0 | `#f2495c` (expensive) |

### Rain (locked)

`#B877D9` — used only for rain volume / rain sparkline. Not reused for any other role.

### Status pills — canonical per-entity states

Consolidated state vocabulary and colours for the status pills used across the redesign. Approved by @matej.pristak 2026-04-19. All pills follow the standard `.pill` chip shape; the coloured dot to the left of the label matches the pill tint.

**Cars (wallbox / EV)**
| State | Colour | Hex | Trigger |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CHARGING` | Orange | `#FF9830` | `charging_wallbox_power > 0` |
| `CONNECTED` | Green | `#73bf69` | Cable plugged, not drawing power |
| `DISCONNECTED` | Gray | `#6a6a6a` | No cable / idle |

**Heat pump**
| State | Colour | Hex | Trigger |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ON` | Green | `#73bf69` | Compressor running |
| `OFF` | Gray | `#6a6a6a` | Idle / standby |

**Krb (fireplace)** — colour depends on both ON/OFF state and body temperature:
| State | Condition | Colour | Hex |
|---|---|---|---|
| `OFF` | body temp < 30 °C | Gray | `#6a6a6a` |
| `OFF` | body temp ≥ 30 °C | Red | `#f2495c` |
| `ON` | body temp < 65 °C | Green | `#73bf69` |
| `ON` | body temp ≥ 65 °C | Orange | `#FF9830` |

Rationale: residual hot mass after shutdown (OFF + hot) is surfaced in red as a safety cue; running hot (ON + ≥ 65 °C) is surfaced in orange so it's visibly distinct from steady-state green.

**Rooms (indoor heating zones)**
| State | Colour | Hex | Trigger |
|---|---|---|---|
| `IDLE` | Gray | `#6a6a6a` | Zone at/above setpoint, no call for heat |
| `HEATING` | Orange | `#FF9830` | Zone below setpoint, actively calling for heat |

Supersedes the earlier `Krb ON/OFF` pair in the UI Colors table (which used a simple two-colour mapping without the temperature bands).

## Typography Scale

Six-tier scale derived from the Outdoor panel. Use these tokens consistently across every panel; do not introduce one-off sizes.

### Scale tokens

| Token | px | Canonical source | Role |
|-------|----|------------------|------|
| **XL** | 110 | Outdoor hero temperature (`.wx-temp-group .num`) | Dashboard-wide hero — one per dashboard |
| **L**  | 64  | Outdoor clock (`.wx-clock .time`) | Primary panel metric |
| **M**  | 44  | Outdoor stats value (`.wx-stats .val`, e.g. humidity) | Key stat / secondary hero |
| **S**  | 30  | Car SoC (`.car-soc`), generic stat-bar value (`.stat-bar .s .val`) | Tertiary stat / stat-bar values |
| **XS** | 22  | Room humidity (`.room .hum`) | Inline values, big captions, deltas |
| **micro** | 11 | Graph tick labels, stat-bar labels (`.stat-bar .s .lab`) | Axis ticks, uppercase captions |

**Rules**
- **XL is reserved for the Outdoor temperature hero.** No other panel should use XL.
- Each panel has at most one L-sized number (the panel hero).
- Numbers below micro (9–10px) are only acceptable for inline markers/badges on charts (e.g. the `TARGET 80%` chip above the car SoC bar).
- Line-height 1.0 for XL/L; 1.15 for M; default for S and below.
- Units (`°`, `%`, `kWh`, etc.) next to a big number render ~40–50 % of the parent size, in `--dim`.

### Per-panel mapping

**Outdoor (reference panel)**
- Temperature hero `12.3°` → **XL** (110)
- Clock `16:16` → **L** (64)
- Humidity / Wind / Rain stat values → **M** (44)
- Hi / Lo temperatures → **S** (30)
- Date under clock → **S** (30)
- Stat sub-values (`/2`, `6/7`) → **XS** (22)

**Indoor / Rooms**
- Room temperature `21.3°` → **M** (44)
- Room name → **S** (30)
- Room humidity → **S** (30)
- Target chip → **micro** (~11)
- CO₂ stat footer → **S** (30)

**Energy — topology + chart + stat-bar**
- Inverter / topology node values (solar kW, batt kW, house kW) → **M** (44)
- Stat-bar Self-suff / Virt.batt values → **S** (30)
- Diverging cons / prod numbers → **S** (30)
- Diverging delta `+3.3 / −61` → **XS** (22)
- Chart axis ticks, legends → **micro** (11)

**Heating**
- Heat-tile primary (`21.1°`, `44.9`, Pump pill) → **L** (64)
- Stat-bar flow / return / Δ → **S** (30)
- Sub-captions / trend labels → **micro** (~11–13)

**Vehicles**
- Car name (`Enyaq`, `ID.3`) → **M** (44)
- SoC `67%` → **S** (30)
- Range / max / status / timeleft → **S** (30) — bumped from micro for tablet-in-sunlight legibility
- Charge timeleft is rendered **unconverted in minutes** (e.g. `~640 min`), matching the raw `charging_time_left_*` field unit — no hours/minutes split, no amperage, no "to full" prefix
- Target label above marker → **micro** (~9–11)

Any new panel must declare its mapping against this scale before being implemented.

## Query Patterns

All Business Text panels use the same Flux pattern:

1. **findRecord** to extract each field as a scalar value
2. **`if exists ... then ... else 0.0`** for null safety
3. **`float(v:)`** cast to avoid type mismatch errors
4. **`math.round()`** for clean display values (1 decimal: `* 10.0 / 10.0`, 2 decimal: `* 100.0 / 100.0`)
5. **`array.from(rows: [...])`** to build final single-row output
6. **Safe union+default pattern** for optional fields: union a default row `{_time: 2000-01-01, _value: 0.0}` with real data, sort by time, take last — guarantees a value exists even if no data

### Business Text Panel Settings

- Render template: **Every row**
- Primary Content Language: **Handlebars**
- Wrap automatically in paragraphs: **Disabled**
- Handlebars helpers: `gt` (built-in), `eq` (built-in); custom: `lt`, `abs`, `gte` (registered in helpers/afterRender JS)

### Flux Query

```flux
import "array"
import "math"
import "strings"
import "date"
import "timezone"

option location = timezone.location(name: "Europe/Prague")

// Current weather values (findRecord pattern)
temp, maxtemp, mintemp, humidity, precip, precipRate, windSpeed,
windGust, precipTotal, wind30m, windGust30m  — each from respective measurements

// Hourly forecast data (encoded as "H:val,H:val,..." strings)
hourly_data   — TempForecast.temperature (today, sorted by hour)
rain_data     — RainForecast.precipitation (today)
wind_data     — WindForecast.wind_speed (today)

// Solar radiation (current)
solarRad — weather.solarRadiation (last)

// Output: single row
array.from(rows: [{
  temp, hi, lo, humidity, rain_fc, rain_rate, rain_total,
  wind, gust, wind_30m, gust_30m,
  hourly (string), rain_hourly (string), wind_hourly (string),
  solar_radiation
}])
```

### Rounding

| Field | Precision | Method |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| temp, rain_fc, rain_rate, rain_total | 1 decimal | `* 10.0 / 10.0` |
| hi, lo, humidity, wind, gust, wind_30m, gust_30m | integer | `math.round()` |

### Content Template (Handlebars + HTML)

Data attributes are set on the root div (`data-temp`, `data-hourly`, etc.) and read by afterRender JS.

- **Hero row:** Weather icon (dynamic SVG: sun+cloud for day, cloud for night/rain, rain drops for >1mm/h), big temperature, hi/lo, live clock (updated every 1s via setInterval)
- **Sparkline:** SVG rendered in afterRender JS using Catmull-Rom spline interpolation for smooth curves
  - Temperature line with continuous color gradient (dark blue → light blue → yellow → orange → red) based on hourly temperature values, area fill uses same gradient at 15% opacity
  - Purple rain bars (#B877D9) with opacity proportional to amount
  - Blue wind line (#5794F2, opacity 0.6)
  - Now marker: temperature-colored dot + dashed vertical line (color matches current interpolated temperature)
  - Hi/Lo peak labels (orange/blue)
  - Hour labels every 3h
- **Stats bar:** 3-section flex layout with separators
  - Humidity (flex: 0.67): blue value
  - Wind: current + 30m max (white / orange), slash notation with gusts
  - Rain: rate (mm/h) + forecast (fc) + total (tot), all purple

### Color Logic

| Element | Condition | Color |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Temperature text | ≤ -10°C | `#1565C0` (dark blue) |
| Temperature text | 0°C | `#4fc3f7` (light blue) |
| Temperature text | 10°C | `#f2cc0c` (yellow) |
| Temperature text | 20°C | `#FF9830` (orange) |
| Temperature text | ≥ 30°C | `#f2495c` (red) |
| Temperature text | intermediate | continuous RGB interpolation between stops |
| Temp sparkline | per-hour | horizontal SVG gradient using same 5-stop scale |
| Weather icon | rain rate > 1 | Cloud with rain drops |
| Weather icon | rain rate > 0 | Double cloud (overcast) |
| Weather icon | day (7-19h) | Sun + cloud |
| Weather icon | night | Double cloud |

Each room is a `.indoor-room` card containing:
- Room name (`.indoor-name`, 0.8vw)
- Temperature (`.indoor-temp`, 1.8vw) — color from gradient table
- Target (`.indoor-target`, 1.1vw) with `▸` arrow prefix
- Humidity (`.indoor-hum`, 1.4vw, blue) — Obyvacka & Pracovna only
- Heating indicator `▲` (`.indoor-heat-arrow`, orange #FF9830) — shown when `*_on > 0`

**Right column — Status:**
- **Krb**: ON/OFF based on `krb_w > 20` — green/red
- **Krb T**: fireplace temperature with gradient coloring (>70 red, 60-70 gradient, 15-60 green, <15 cold gradient)
- **COP 24h**: coefficient of performance, always green #73bf69
- **CO2**: large card (`.indoor-heat-row-lg`), colored by threshold (green <800, orange 800-1000, red >1000), shows "ppm" unit

### Krb Temperature Color Logic

| Range | Color | Hex |

### Canvas Rendering (afterRender JS)

Each cell has a `<canvas>` element. The afterRender JS uses `requestAnimationFrame` with ~250ms frame skipping (~4fps) and **auto-stops after 3 seconds**. Since Grafana re-renders the panel every 10s (data refresh), `afterRender` re-triggers and animates for another 3s burst. Between bursts, zero CPU/memory cost.

**Performance optimizations (v6.1):**
- No `shadowBlur` anywhere — glow effects use wider, lower-opacity duplicate strokes (10x cheaper on Safari)
- Gradients (`createRadialGradient`, `createLinearGradient`) are created once per data refresh and cached, not per frame (fixes Chrome memory pressure causing tab reloads)
- No CSS infinite `@keyframes` — shimmer/glow on energy bars are static gradient overlays
- Grid direction uses a static colored wire overlay + bouncing arrow (no `lineDashOffset` animation, which is expensive in Safari)
- `requestAnimationFrame` instead of `setInterval` — respects tab visibility, pauses when backgrounded

**Solar cell:** Radial glow (cached gradients), sun icon with animated rays (length proportional to power), solar panel graphic, kW value below. Color shifts green→blue with increasing power.

**House cell:** House outline with animated glowing windows (number lit ∝ consumption). Glow via double-filled rects (no shadowBlur). Hue shifts green→yellow→red with load. Value below.

**Battery cell:** Horizontal battery shape with fill bar (width = SoC%, cached gradient using 5-tier SoC colors), ±kW value. SoC% text is always white `#fff` for contrast against the colored fill. Time remaining shown below when charging/discharging. State color: green `#44ee44` when charging (bat < -0.25 kW), red `#ff4444` when discharging (bat > 0.25 kW), gray `#666` when idle. Border and terminal colored by state; pulsing border glow via wider stroke (no shadowBlur). No bolt icon — removed to keep SoC% readable.

**Grid cell:** Transmission line graphic with static colored overlay (opacity ∝ power magnitude). Arrow bounces left/right. Value + IMPORT/EXPORT/BALANCED badge.

**Wallbox cell:** Charger station with cable to car graphic. Charge level bars inside car (signal-bar style). Pulsing when actively charging. Greyed out when disconnected (`.pf6-off`).

**Self-Sufficiency cell:** 270° arc gauge, percentage in center. Glow via wider lower-opacity stroke (no shadowBlur). Color: ≥80% green, ≥50% orange, <50% red.

**Virtual Battery cell:** Smaller arc gauge + SOLD/BOUGHT footer with values. Same glow technique.

**Today/Month cells:** Dual horizontal bar gauges with static shimmer overlay. Consumed (red gradient) and Produced (green gradient), proportional to max of both.

### Grid Badge Colors

| State | Background | Text | Threshold |
|-------|-----------|------|-----------|
| IMPORT | `#3a1a1a` | `#ff5050` | meter < -0.25 kW |
| EXPORT | `#1c3a20` | `#50ff78` | meter > +0.25 kW |
| BALANCED | `#1a2a3a` | `#50a0ff` | \|meter\| ≤ 0.25 kW |

Row 1: car name · SoC bar (with TARGET marker + label) · SoC %.
Row 2: range · max range · optional charge time-left · status pill.

### Flux Query

```flux
import "math"
import "array"

// Per-car: soc, range, time_left
// Union + pivot pattern to build 2 rows

// Shared wallbox power (safe union+default)
// Default time_left rows (0.0)

// Computed: max_range = range / soc * 100

// Output: 2 rows with car, soc, range, max_range, charge_w, time_left
```

### SoC Bar Design (v5, fixed-band technique)

The bar track is full width (100 %) and carries a hard-stop gradient — each tier has a fixed on-screen width regardless of SoC. An opaque cover sits on the right (width = 100 − SoC %) and hides the unfilled portion. Hard stops at 10 / 20 / 30 / 90 %:

```
linear-gradient(90deg,
  #f2495c 0%,  #f2495c 10%,
  #FF6B3D 10%, #FF6B3D 20%,
  #FF9830 20%, #FF9830 30%,
  #73bf69 30%, #73bf69 90%,
  #5794F2 90%, #5794F2 100%);
```

A yellow TARGET marker (`#FADE2A`, 3 × 26 px, overflows the bar top/bottom) sits at the target-SoC position, with a 9 px `TARGET 80%` chip above.

**Charging animation** (ported from `panel-61-cars.jsx`): `@keyframes car-pulse { 0%,100% { opacity:1; } 50% { opacity:.4; } }`, 2 s ease-in-out, applied to the gradient layer only so the cover, target marker, and target label stay static.

### SoC text colour (C10)

The SoC % number follows the same 5-tier ramp as the bar:

| SoC Range | Color | Hex |
|-----------|-------|-----|
| > 90% | Blue | `#5794F2` |
| 30–90% | Green | `#73BF69` |
| 20–30% | Orange | `#FF9830` |
| 10–20% | Orange-red | `#FF6B3D` |
| < 10% | Red | `#F2495C` |

### Status pill (row 2, right-aligned)

Per the **Status pills → Cars (wallbox / EV)** table: `CHARGING` (orange), `CONNECTED` (green), `DISCONNECTED` (gray). Pill uses the standard `.pill` chip with a coloured dot.

### Stats row (row 2)

- **Range** always shown (plain text colour)
- **Max range** always shown, dim (`#8e8e8e`)
- **Time left** shown only when `time_left > 0`, orange (`#FF9830`), rendered **unconverted in minutes** (e.g. `~640 min`) — no hours/minutes split, no amperage, no "to full" prefix
- `charge_w` is in query output but not displayed (used by power flow panel)

### Typography (v5)

| Element | Token | px |
|---|---|---|
| Car name (`Enyaq`, `ID.3`) | M | 44 |
| SoC `67%` | S | 30 |
| Range / max / status / timeleft | S | 30 |
| `TARGET 80%` label | micro | ~9 |

## Grafana Compatibility Notes

- `@keyframes` with `background-color` works in Business Text; `opacity` animation and `::after` pseudo-elements do **not**
- Real DOM elements must be used instead of CSS pseudo-elements for overlays
- Inline `style` attributes on Handlebars-generated elements work reliably
- `disable_sanitize_html = true` required in `grafana.ini` `[panels]` section
- Canvas rendering via `afterRender` JS uses `setInterval` at 250ms (~4fps), not `requestAnimationFrame` (Safari compatibility)
- `handlebars` variable is available in the **helpers** editor (Before rendering content), NOT in afterRender
- Custom helpers (`lt`, `abs`, `gte`) must be registered via `handlebars.registerHelper()` in the helpers editor
- All sizes use `vw` units for responsive scaling across different screen sizes
- The `afterRender` function runs after each data refresh — clean up previous animations (e.g., `cancelAnimationFrame`, `clearInterval`) at the start
